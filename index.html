            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>I've been working on this store for a while it use to be named EnviiStudios and I did things kinda all over the place. So I've decided to take some time off to learn how to run a business and take a different approach. I ended up rebranding my whole store. And so begins XenasFox. I want to be more engaging and more Structured. I have realized that having set goals and more content is a better way for me to get people to join me on my Art journey. I've always had this fear of people not liking me for who I am but realized if I just am myself and do me the right people will start to follow. I've always got excited when I created new items and I loved showing them to others. I'm still on my learning journey and I'm excited to have you join me.</p>
